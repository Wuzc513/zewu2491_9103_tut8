## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my Java project, I am inspired to adopt a cyberpunk theme, particularly influenced by the futuristic cityscapes in the movie "Blade Runner 2049". The film creates an immersive cyberpunk world with its high-contrast neon lighting against the dark urban backdrop. I plan to incorporate a similar visual style into my project, especially the dynamic lighting and color contrasts seen in the movie, to craft an engaging user interface. I believe this technique will enhance the user experience, making the project more compelling and contemporary.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I would like to be able to achieve the following effect by calling the relevant function in java: when the mouse makes a special command, the saturation of the screen will be changed. I want to be able to simulate the light pollution featured in the cyberpunk world with this effect.

## mouseDragged()
Description: A function that's called when the mouse moves while a button is pressed.(https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseDragged)

## saturation()
Description: Gets the saturation value of a color.(https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/saturation)



## Alpha Mask
Also, use Alpha Mask related effects to add a sense of psychedelic ambience.(https://p5js.org/examples/image-alpha-mask.html)
